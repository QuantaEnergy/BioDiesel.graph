>Finished biodiesel should be stored in steel drums, poly totes or yellow diesel cans, and these containers should be clearly marked as containing biodiesel. Biodiesel is a good solvent. It will dissolve rubber and some plastics, remove paint, oxidize aluminum and other metals and has been reported to destroy asphalt and concrete if spills were not cleaned quickly. Most petroleum fueling equipment can be used for biodiesel but the equipment degrades more quickly. For more information, see the ATTRA publication Biodiesel Use, Handling, and Fuel Quality.
