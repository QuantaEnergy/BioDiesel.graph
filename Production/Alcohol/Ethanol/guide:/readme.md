>### Using a Simple, Greener Chemistry
>For many producers-and future producers-the idea of using a process in which you could simply mix alcohol and oil, pour it over a catalyst and collect the products as they drip into a receiver (flask, jar or other collection vessel) is very attractive.

>There's good news. These non-alkali methods have been developed by research chemists. These processes are not only simple, but flexible as well.

>First, a biodiesel producer could easily use ethanol in place of methanol, even if the ethanol contains a little water. Ethanol is much less toxic than methanol, and you've probably tasted it if you've ever consumed gin, vodka, rum or wine. Ethanol is metabolized in the body to acetaldehyde, which quickly converts to acetic acid (which in dilute form is ordinary vinegar). The author doesn't recommend that you start drinking, but at least you'll know that you and your staff are **less likely to go blind** if you're exposed to a little alcohol vapor from the ethanol (caution: nobody suggests drinking the ethanol at home).
