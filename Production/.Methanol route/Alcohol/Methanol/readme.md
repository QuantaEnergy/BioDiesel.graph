>Methanol, or wood alcohol, was once made through pyrolysis of wood, but now methanol is made primarily from natural gas. It is used as a gas-line antifreeze and for racing fuel. Methanol is available from chemical suppliers. Methanol in 55-gallon drums is available from fuel dealers, auto parts stores or speed shops. HEET gas-line antifreeze is 99-percent pure methanol and can be used to make small batches of biodiesel. Be sure to purchase HEET that is sold in yellow bottles. Iso-HEET, which is sold in red bottles, is isopropyl alcohol and will not work. Do not assume that fuel-line antifreeze is pure methanol unless it is labeled as such. Be sure to use nearly pure methanol.
