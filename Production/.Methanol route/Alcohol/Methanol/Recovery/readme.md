>Methanol Recovery
>Because much of the methanol used in transesterification remains in the by-product after reaction, it can be advantageous to recover the unused alcohol for several reasons. First, reusing the recovered methanol can save a considerable amount of money when producing significant volumes of biodiesel. Second, once the alcohol is removed the glycerol by-product becomes glycerin, a much more environmentally friendly product with countless uses.

>Methanol recovery can be achieved through the distillation process by heating the glycerol to a temperature above the boiling point of methanol, 148 degrees Fahrenheit at sea level. This temperature is lower if the process is performed at a lower pressure. Attaching a vacuum pump to the distilling tank lowers the danger of explosion. The vaporized methanol must then be passed through a condenser, cooled and recaptured as a liquid. Biodiesel researchers and enthusiasts are currently exploring several systems and links to more information can be found in the Further Resources section of this publication. Several methanol recovery systems rely again on a water heater to provide a relatively safe, sealed tank to heat the glycerol and automotive condensers or homemade cooling towers. Because biodiesel made with sodium hydroxide will produce a glycerol that is more solid when cool, it is best to use potassium hydroxide if recovering the methanol, or pump the sodium hydroxide methanol directly in to the distilling unit while it is still hot.
