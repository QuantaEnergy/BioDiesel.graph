>Wear an appropriate respirator when making biodiesel. The only approved respirators for methanol are respirators with external air supplies. For information on obtaining a respirator, see the Further resources section at the end of this publication. Other necessary equipment includes heavy rubber gloves, safety goggles and clothing that will protect your skin from chemicals, especially methanol. Methanol can be absorbed through the skin and cause illness, blindness and debilitation.

>Do not use anything that comes in contact with biodiesel or the chemicals used to make biodiesel for food production. Making biodiesel requires a well-ventilated area to reduce the danger of fire and explosion and exposure to methanol. Methanol can vaporize, and when mixed with the proper amount of oxygen and an ignition source, can ignite with an invisible flame. When making biodiesel in larger quantities, make it outside or in a place where there is no chance of a spark or flame coming in contact with the methanol. Any wiring in indoor areas where methanol is used must be explosion-proof.
