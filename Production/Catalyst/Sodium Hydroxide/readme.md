# Comparison:
>Sodium Hydroxide versus Potassium Hydroxide
>Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is the least expensive and most commonly used alkaline component in the small-scale biodiesel product ion process. However, in recent years, potassium hydroxide (KOH) gained popularity because of its superior catalyst properties. Potassium hydroxide dissolves more easily in methanol and is less sensitive to water. In addition, the glycerol, or glycerin by-product of processing with potassium hydroxide, remains liquid and is easier to dispose of. The by-product can also more safely be added to compost piles, used in small quantities as a supplement to animal feed for ruminants or poultry and applied as potassium fertilizer. Using sodium hydroxide contaminates the wash water with salts, rendering it inappropriate for land application. Sodium hydroxide glycerol does have advantages of its own: it makes a superior base for soap or degreaser.
