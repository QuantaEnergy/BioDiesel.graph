>To remove ethanol from gasoline, add a small amount of water to a transparent container filled with the ethanol-laced gasoline, shake vigorously, and then allow the mixture to settle. Because ethanol is hydrophilic and more soluble in water than gasoline, the water will bond with the ethanol, causing the mixture to phase-separate with the water/ethanol layer settling at the bottom of the container. You can then carefully decant or siphon the ethanol-free gasoline off the top.

>- A transparent container
>- Water
>- A small amount of food coloring (optional, for visibility)
>- Two containers for separation

>## Steps
>1. Add Water to Gasoline: Pour the gasoline into a transparent container and add a small amount of water. The amount of water can vary, but a common recommendation is about one 8 oz cup per gallon of gasoline. 
>2. Add Food Coloring (Optional): For better visibility, add a few drops of food coloring to the water before adding it to the gasoline. 
>3. Agitate the Mixture: Seal the container and shake it vigorously to mix the water and gasoline. This allows the ethanol to break its bonds with the gasoline and form new bonds with the water molecules. 
>4. Allow to Settle: Let the mixture stand for several hours or overnight to allow the water and ethanol to completely separate from the gasoline. The water/ethanol mixture, being denser, will settle at the bottom. 
>5. Decant the Gasoline: Carefully pour the gasoline from the top into a separate, clean container, being careful not to disturb or siphon off the water/ethanol layer at the bottom.

>## Important Considerations
>- Safety: Gasoline vapors are highly flammable. Perform this process in a well-ventilated area away from any potential ignition sources. 
>- Octane Rating: Removing ethanol will reduce the gasoline's octane rating. You may need to start with a higher octane gasoline to achieve an acceptable result for some engines. 
>- Disposal: The water/ethanol mixture is effectively a form of denatured alcohol and should be disposed of properly, as it is not suitable for use in gasoline engines. 
>- Additives: Ethanol is sometimes added to gasoline to increase octane and act as a fuel system cleaner. Removing it can also remove other additives, such as antioxidants.
