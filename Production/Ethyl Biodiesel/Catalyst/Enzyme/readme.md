>Catalysts: Enzymes or OrganometallicsWhat catalysts should we use if we're not using an alkali, like sodium hydroxide? Well, for one thing, NaOH is not a catalyst but actually a co-reactant, because you have to weigh out a certain amount. Catalysts can be used in small amounts. They do not enter into the reaction. They can be used over and over again without replacement.

>These new catalysts for converting vegetable oil into ethyl biodiesel are not the same as the platinum catalysts in your auto engine. Two types of catalysts can be used: (a) biochemical enzymes or (b) "organometallics" (that is, inert catalysts based on organic and inorganic chemistry).
>
>You might know something about biochemically-derived enzymes, even if you are not a scientist. Enzymes are used in converting (a) milk into cheese, and (b) hops into beer. They are also used in modern enzyme based detergents.

>Enzymes for making biodiesel esters include lipases and other "esterases." The enzymes can be derived from several different sources, ranging from bacterial and yeast cells to pork tissue (depending on your preferences).
>
>The enzymatic process could simply be called the "trickle down theory." All you need to do is to mix the reactants (oil and alcohol/EtOH) and pour them over the column containing the enzyme. You can already buy the enzymes supported on an inexpensive material to prepare your enzyme column.
